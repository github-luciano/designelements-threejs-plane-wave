# ThreeJS Plane Wave

Just a 3D plane wave made with ThreeJS.

Needs this to work:
```
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/88/three.min.js
```
It can be added as `<script>` tag, it (probably) needs to run before your javascript file, so beware of the order of your `<script>` tags.

The file `cdn.js` contains the code contained in the above link, so if the link ever gets broken you can use the code from the file. It doesn't matter what you use, the order of the script tags is supposed to stay as mentioned above.
